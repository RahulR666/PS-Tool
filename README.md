## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- `pip` (Python package manager)

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. **Install dependencies** via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

Simply launch the GUI with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure `main.py` contains your full application code.

---

## 🛠 Packaging for Desktop (Executable)

You can build standalone executables using **PyInstaller**:

### Step 1: Install PyInstaller (if not already)

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### Step 2: Build the App

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed main.py
```

This will generate a standalone app inside the `dist/` folder.

## 🖥️ Platform Packaging Notes

### ✅ Windows

- Output: `dist/main.exe`
- Run by double-clicking the `.exe` file
- Automatically runs as a GUI without terminal popups

### 🍎 macOS

- Output: `dist/main`
- Run with: `./main` or bundle it into a `.app` with additional flags

Optional: To create a native `.app` format:
```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed --onefile --name "DeepTerrainTool" main.py
```

### 🐧 Linux

- Output: `dist/main`
- Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x dist/main
./dist/main
```
